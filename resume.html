                  <p>Back in high school, my only concern was to pass the exams with good grades and follow the goal set by my parents of becoming a doctor. During the COVID-19 lockdown time, I suddenly had more time at home and began to ask myself if I really want to pursue this career for the next 6-8 years. In the end, after much contemplation and consulting with my family, classmates and teachers, I decided to take my leave of absence from school at the end of the 2nd year.</p>

                  <p>This was a courageous endeavour that didn’t have a title. It was quite important to my overall development though so I’m adding it to my CV. Also it explains the gap in my CV.</p>

                      <li>Learned programming on freeCodeCamp, CS50</li><li>I also stumbled upon the FOSS community and developed a deep appreciation for it. Today, I use Neovim to write both my LaTeX math notes and other notes that use the markdown syntax. For my front-end projects though, I still use the vim emulation extension in VSCode.</li><li>Refresh my memory about Math since it was my most favourite subject in High School even though my major was biology. I discovered LaTeX which is used to write beautiful math notations.</li><li>Learned Chinese characters. It is worth mentioning that I do not specifically learn Chinese Mandarin. Learning Chinese characters gives me a deeper appreciation regarding the East Asian culture sphere as well as open many opportunities in the future.</li>

                  <p>I decided to take learning web development seriously. During my two years at FPT Aptech, I found myself in a very nice environment, compared to self-study at home, with enthusiast lecturers and friendly classmates. They had taught me a lot and also gave me the motivation to keep following this path.</p>
